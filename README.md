# Movies Temple
Android application written in Kotlin
It used to be a part of the project in Udacity course (https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801), howerever I decided to convert it completely to newer technology.

As the result the complete application is available on Google Play store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lukasz.witkowski.android.moviestemple

To run application you have to create account on the ThemovieDB website( https://www.themoviedb.org/). Then in app/src/main/java/utilities/NetworkUtil  set api_key field to string with your personal API_KEY (https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)

Application get data from TheMmovieDB : https://www.themoviedb.org/
